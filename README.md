# E-commerce Back End Challenge
This challenge had us set up the backend of an E-commerce site. 

## Description
The topics covered in this challenge were using dotenv to keep passwords safe, writing routes and leveraging SQL through Sequelize, and setting up many to one and many to many relationships between data.

## Additional Information
### Notes
The most challenging piece of this challenge was given to us in the starter code for this week and that is the Create and Update routes for the Product. The reason this was challenging was the nature of the many to many relationship between Products and Tags. So when creating a Product we would need to also account for associated tags, likewise if we're updating a product we could be removing or adding a tag so we need to account for both scenarios as well.
